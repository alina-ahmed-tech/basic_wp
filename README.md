This is a custom WordPress Classic Theme developed in Visual Studio Code. Contains Custom Post Types and ACF. 

Upon switching to this theme: 
* 2 demo pages (About, Portfolio)
* Item homepage is set to the About page
* 3 demo blog posts
* 3 demo projects (custom post type) one for each ACF (custom field called 'type' which can be either 'WordPress', 'Software' or 'AI').
  
The ACF is baked into this theme, so no dependencies are required to be installed for this theme to work.
